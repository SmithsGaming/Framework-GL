Framework-GL
===============

Simple OpenGL framework for Java which uses LWJGL as the backend. While the
framework has support for compatibility mode the emphasis is on targeting
modern practices using OpenGL 3.3.

Framework-GL has the following features :

- Basic rendering for immediate mode, display lists, vertex arrays,
  vertex buffer objects (dynamic & interleaved) using OpenGL 1.X.
- Builders (Frame buffer object & textures)
- Dynamic mesh builder for capsules, cones, cubes, cylinders,
  frustums, grids, pyramids, quads, spheres and toriods.
- Frustum culling in clip space.
- Math library (AABBs, matrices, quaternions and vectors)
- Model loading (OBJ & MTL)
- OpenGL constants have been organized to be more useful.
- OpenGL helpers for display lists, frame buffer objects, legacy
  rendering, render buffer objects, shaders, textures, vertex arrays
  and vertex buffer objects.
- Texture loading (BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, TGA, and TIFF)
- Multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)
- Examples
